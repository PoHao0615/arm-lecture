# arm-lecture
ARM programs to illustrate tutorials
This repository fork from the embedded course teach by Jim Huaug. 

There is something that I modify to achieve the request of homework.
1. Modify the function "add" as function "div" at example1.
2. Use recursive way to achieve Fibonacci Sequence by using ARM assembly.
3. Use non-recursive way to achieve Fibonacci Sequence by using ARM assembly.
4. Try to optimize the code.
